## Overview

This essay examines the mechanisms through which confirmation bias, homophily, and echo chambers contribute to societal division in the digital age. Drawing on data from 164 countries (Digital Society Project), the analysis demonstrates how fragmented online environments facilitate the formation of polarized "digital tribes" that threaten deliberative democracy.

## Key Findings

- **Three interconnected mechanisms** drive digital polarization: confirmation bias, homophilic clustering, and group radicalization
- **Digital tribalism**: Information functions as identity propositions rather than knowledge sources in fractionalized environments
